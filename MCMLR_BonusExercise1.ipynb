You can utilize Ethnologue (https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/ethnologue200) to search for languages and detect the language family (\"Classification\" when you click on a language). At least one person of your group should be able to speak the second language, the third can be any language of your choice (make sure the below tools support the languages you want to select!).\n",
